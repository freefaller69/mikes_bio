        "Originally hailing from the mean streets of Ballard, Mike’s family moved to Whidbey Island when he was 9.  While not far from Seattle, it seemed worlds away from the crowds and traffic.  He attended school there through his freshman year but finished high school at Seattle Prep on Capitol Hill.  From there he attended Seattle University and then the University of Washington, studying history and language but also spending a fair amount of time in the computer lab."

        "Mike enjoys travel and has had the opportunity to visit a number of places, including the Caribbean, Mexico, and Maui.  He has also been to Las Vegas a few times, including a road trip where his car blew a head gasket in the middle of the Mojave Desert on the way back.",
        "Outside of travel, Mike enjoys photography, snowboarding (although it’s been awhile), music, movies, and video games.  He has been skydiving a few times, and the first three times he ever flew was to jump out of the aircraft."

        "Mike has worked in a variety of fields.  He started off in the restaurant industry.  Seeking new challenges, he moved to the print industry working in a pre-press shop producing film for a number of publications such as For Rent magazine.  It was during this time that Mike learned HTML and CSS.  Following that, he worked in customer support for AT&T wireless when the first data capable phones came on the market and were text only.  From there he found his way into payroll and government accounting work where he spent a number of years, although his favorite thing to do in this role was finding ways to automate routine tasks in Excel and Access for the benefit of himself and the teams he was part of.  He also put his technical skills to use doing freelance tech support and building stating web pages outside of his day job and really enjoyed the challenge of designing and building things.",
        "While living in Western Montana, Mike finally gave in to the pull of web development and decided to leave payroll and accounting behind.  He signed up for the Coding Dojo online program where he learned Python, Angular, Node, and NoSQL databases to add to his existing knowledge.  Since completing the program, he has worked remotely for a startup that never quite started, a short stint at Moby in Fremont while one of their devs was out on paternity leave, and spent a little over half of 2019 living in Louisville, KY while working at ADP porting part of their AngularJS build over to Angular 7.  Shortly before leaving Kentucky to return to Washington, Mike was contacted about an opportunity to work in an associate program at Microsoft which bring us up to now."
